## CSE210A-Programming Languages
# Homework 2:WHILE

As part of this assignment, we were expected to write an interpreter for the WHILE language with any additional features.
Programming Language used:Python3
Executable Created using pyinstaller
External library used:lark parser used to create the AST.
Files accepted as part of the assignment submission are:
- README.txt
- MakeFile
- while.py
- while
- TestingOutput.pdf
- extras.bat (Individual tests)
- gitlog.txt

## How to run:
 Use the following commands in the terminal:
 - make
 - ./while
 - (enter the expression in the while language to be evaluated)
 - ./test.sh (to run the test script)

## Additional Features:
